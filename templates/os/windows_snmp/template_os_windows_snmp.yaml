          Description: Doesn't support In/Out 64 bit counters even though IfxTable is present:
        Currently, Windows gets itâ€™s interface status from MIB-2. Since these 64bit SNMP counters (ifHCInOctets, ifHCOutOctets, etc.) are defined as an extension to IF-MIB, Microsoft has not implemented it.
