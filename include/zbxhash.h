** Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).
**
** This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
** text is available at
**	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
** The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
** (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
** any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
** copyrighted.
**
** The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
** <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
** that follows (in reverse chronological order):
**
** 2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
**	references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
**	now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
** 1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
** 1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
**	added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
**	Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
** 1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

/*
** This package supports both compile-time and run-time determination of CPU
** byte order.  If ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is defined as 0, the code will be
** compiled to run only on little-endian CPUs; if ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is
** defined as non-zero, the code will be compiled to run only on big-endian
** CPUs; if ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is not defined, the code will be compiled to
** run on either big- or little-endian CPUs, but will run slightly less
** efficiently on either one than if ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is defined.
